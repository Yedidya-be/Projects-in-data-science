    "# Introduction: Detecting Dividing Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Class 3 of the \"Projects in Data Science\" course! In our previous session, we explored the world of labeling and annotating cells using Napari. Today, we will take a deep dive into cell detection and focus on building a function that can identify cells undergoing division.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we will leverage the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous class to develop an algorithm that detects dividing cells within images. We will utilize the Napari library's functionalities to load and visualize cell images, annotate dividing cells, and build a custom function for automatic detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, we will cover the following key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leveraging Napari to visualize the cell images and perform manual annotations of dividing cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploring techniques for feature extraction and identifying distinguishing characteristics of dividing cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implementing a detection algorithm based on the extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluating the performance of our detection function and fine-tuning it if necessary.\n",

    "Now that we have explored different features and potential feature engineering techniques, it's time to build a classification function that can determine whether two cells are dividing or not. Based on your knowledge of the features and insights gained from the analysis, you can use various approaches to classify the cells.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Threshold-based approach:** Define thresholds for one or more features that can effectively separate dividing and non-dividing cells. For example, you can set a threshold on the aspect ratio and classify cells with aspect ratios above the threshold as dividing cells. Similarly, you can set thresholds on other relevant features based on your domain knowledge.\n",

    "2. **Statistical methods:** Utilize statistical methods such as clustering or Gaussian mixture models to identify distinct groups or clusters of cells. Assign cells to the dividing or non-dividing group based on their cluster membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Machine learning algorithms:** Train a classification model using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines. Use a labeled dataset with features and corresponding labels (dividing or non-dividing) to train the model, and then use it to predict the labels for new unseen data.\n",

    "1. Determine the features or combination of features that you believe are most indicative of cell division based on your analysis.\n",

    "2. Choose an appropriate classification method based on your problem and available resources (e.g., threshold-based, statistical, or machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the classification function using the chosen method. If using machine learning algorithms, you can leverage libraries such as scikit-learn to facilitate the model training and prediction process.\n",
