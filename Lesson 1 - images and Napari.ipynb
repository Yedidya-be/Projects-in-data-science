    "\n",
    "Welcome to the \"Project in Data Sciences\" course! In this course, we will be working with par-seqFISH data in raw format to explore various aspects of data analysis and visualization using Python. The main goal of this course is to gain practical skills in analyzing and interpreting biological data to gain insights into gene expression levels and dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is divided into three parts:\n",
    "### Part 1: Working with Images\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the course, we will learn how to handle and process images, specifically using the par-seqFISH data in the nd2 format. We will explore techniques for image manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries such as Napari, NumPy, and OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Objects and Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of the course, we will delve into the concept of objects and segmentation in images. We will learn how to identify and extract objects of interest from the par-seqFISH images, and perform basic image segmentation techniques to separate cells into different conditions. We will also explore techniques for measuring various cellular properties such as size, DAPI, and rRNA distributions using image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final part of the course, we will bring together the skills and knowledge gained from the previous parts to work on a final project. This project will involve analyzing gene expression levels and their dynamics in the par-seqFISH data, and applying various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain meaningful insights.\n"

    "\n",
    "To ensure a clean and isolated working environment, we will be using Conda, a popular package management system and environment manager for Python. Conda allows us to create and manage virtual environments with specific dependencies for our project, which can help avoid conflicts between different packages and ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps to open a Conda environment:\n",

    "1. Open Anaconda or Miniconda: If you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your machine, open the Anaconda Navigator or the Conda command prompt, respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`conda create -n my_env python=3.8`\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace \"my_env\" with the name you want to give to your environment, and \"python=3.8\" with the desired Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the Conda command prompt, run the following command to activate the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda activate my_env`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install libraries: With the Conda environment activated, we can now install the required packages. In the Conda command prompt, run the following commands to install NumPy, Napari, plt, and nd2:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c conda-forge napari`\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install nd2`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Verify the Installation: To verify that NumPy and Napari are successfully installed, you can run the following Python code in your Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import napari\n",
    "import nd2\n",
    "import matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there are no errors, you are all set to start working with images using NumPy and Napari in your Conda environment!\n",
    "\n",
    "With NumPy and Napari installed, you now have the necessary tools to manipulate and analyze par-seqFISH images in Python. Let's move forward and explore the exciting world of image analysis and visualization in the next sections!"
