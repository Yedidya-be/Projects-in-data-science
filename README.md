# Project in Data Sciences Course

Welcome to the "Project in Data Sciences" course! In this course, we will be working with par-seqFISH data in raw format to explore various aspects of data analysis and visualization using Python. The main goal of this course is to gain practical skills in analyzing and interpreting biological data to gain insights into gene expression levels and dynamics.

The course is divided into three parts:
### Part 1: Working with Images

In the first part of the course, we will learn how to handle and process images, specifically using the par-seqFISH data in the nd2 format. We will explore techniques for image manipulation, visualization, and analysis using Python libraries such as Napari, NumPy, and OpenCV.

### Part 2: Objects and Segmentation

In the second part of the course, we will delve into the concept of objects and segmentation in images. We will learn how to identify and extract objects of interest from the par-seqFISH images, and perform image segmentation techniques to separate cells into different conditions. We will also explore techniques for measuring various cellular properties such as size, DNA content, and ribosomes content distributions using image analysis.

### Part 3: Final Project

In the final part of the course, we will bring together the skills and knowledge gained from the previous parts to work on a final project. This project will involve analyzing gene expression levels and their dynamics in the par-seqFISH data, and applying various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain meaningful insights.

## Instructions

Each exercise has its own subdirectory. In it, you will find a short README with instructions exercise and get started with the exercise Jupyter notebook. All other instructions and task descriptions are contained in the notebook.
